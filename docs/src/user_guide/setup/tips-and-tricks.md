# Tips & Tricks

### Learning specific media

If you want to learn a specific piece of media—like a book or a movie—a targeted [priority file](prioritizing.md) can speed things
up compared to a general one. However, ou should only really do this after you have already learned **at least** the
most frequent 2k morphs. If you start to specialize too early you can fall into the trap of "over-fitting"
your vocabulary and understanding of the language.

### Reverting AnkiMorphs changes

There are a couple of ways to revert the changes AnkiMorphs has made to your card collection:

- Restore from a previous backup you made.
- If you only want to revert how AnkiMorphs sorted the cards, then you can do the following:    
  `Browse -> Card State -> New cards -> Select all (Ctrl + A) -> Forget -> Restore original position where possible`
