# Tips & Tricks

### Learning specific media

If you want to learn a specific piece of media, e.g. a book, a movie, etc., then using a more specialized/targeted
[frequency.csv](prioritizing.md#frequencycsv) can help you reach your goal faster than if you were to use a more general
frequency.csv. You should only really do this after you have already learned **at least** the most frequent 2k morphs
from a general frequency.csv--If you start to specialize too early you can fall into the trap of 'over-fitting'
your vocabulary and understanding of the language.

### Reverting AnkiMorphs changes

There are a couple of ways to revert the changes AnkiMorphs has made to your card collection:

- Restore from a previous backup you made.
- If you only want to revert how AnkiMorphs sorted the cards, then you can do the following:    
  `Browse -> Card State -> New cards -> Select all (Ctrl + A) -> Forget -> Restore original position where possible`
