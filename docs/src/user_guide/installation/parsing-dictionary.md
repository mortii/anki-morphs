# Parsing Dictionary

In order to keep track of what you know, AnkiMorphs uses a parsing dictionary to divide up sentences into
individual [morphs](../glossary.md#morph).

AnkiMorphs comes pre-packaged with parsing dictionaries for some languages, but for Japanese the user must install one
separately in order for AnkiMorphs to function.

> **Note**: parsing dictionaries are only for parsing and can’t be used to obtain definitions for words.

## Japanese Parsing Dictionary

The most advanced Japanese parsing dictionary currently available for AnkiMorphs is the "MeCab UniDic" dictionary. Once
it is installed, simply restart Anki and AnkiMorphs will automatically start using MeCab UniDic for parsing.
