# Setup

## Linux

1. **Installing python 3.13**:  
   The latest version of Anki uses python 3.13, and we need our dev environment to match the prod environment in order
   to catch any bugs that are exclusive to those particular set of dependencies.

   When this command succeeds:
   ```
   $ python3.13 --version
   Python 3.13.[x]
   ```
   then you are ready move on to the next step.
2. **Setting up the dev environment:**

   We want to use a virtual environment for a few reasons: we don't want to install the project's dependencies on the
   global environment (your pc) because you might end up with package conflicts or accidentally downgrading packages,
   etc; a virtual environment also makes sure the dependencies are consistent for all developers.
    ``` bash
    python3.13 -m pip install --upgrade pip virtualenv
    python3.13 -m virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # <--- this activates the virtual environment
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    pre-commit install
    ```
 
   Also install `Xvfb` on your system, e.g.: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`, this prevents windows popping up when `pre-commit` runs `pytest`.

   Remember to activate the virtual environment any time before you start working on the project, some IDEs do this
   automatically.
2. **Set the project python interpreter** to be `anki-morphs/venv/bin/python` to get your IDE to recognize the packages
   installed above.

3. **Create a soft symbolic link** from the cloned repo to the anki add-ons folder so anki starts using the dev
   AnkiMorphs:
   ``` bash
   ln -s ~/path/to/cloned/repo/anki-morphs/ankimorphs  ~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/ankimorphs
   ```
4. **Using pre-commit**:

   Pre-commit runs some commands (pylint, pytest, etc.) on the code before you commit to make sure the code is in good
   condition. Pre-commit is configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and some of the commands have additional
   configurations in `pyproject.toml`.

   You can run it manually with the command:
   ``` bash
   pre-commit run -a
   ```
   If you want to make an intermediate commit without caring about pre-commit running successfully you can use the
   `--no-verify` flag, e.g.
   ``` bash
   git commit -am "fixed abc" --no-verify
   ```

   Pre-commit can be annoying to use in the same way that it can be annoying to follow traffic-laws--sure it might slow
   you down
   _right now_, but it is much better in the long-run when everybody does it. Pre-commit can help you in three ways:
    - Automatically fix code for you
    - Catch bugs earlier
    - Make code more understandable

   Once you get used to the pre-commit flow it no longer slows you down, and there are only upsides to using it.

   Pre-commit fails in two ways:

    - **Automatically fixed**   
      When a pre-commit hook changes a file (fixing it) then you simply have to re-stage the file
      and re-run the commit. E.g:

      ```bash
      $ vim recalc_main.py
      $ git commit -am "made changes"
      isort (python)..........Failed
        - hook id: isort
        - files were modified by this hook
      Fixing /home/{...}/recalc_main.py
      $ git commit -am "made changes"
        [main c0bd018] made changes
        1 file changed, 56 insertions(+)
       ```

    - **Has to be manually fixed**   
      The majority of the hooks provide warnings that have to be handled manually. Most of the time the required fixes
      provide
      significant improvements to the code, and you might learn something new and become a better programmer in the
      process. Sometimes the suggested errors are
      false-positive, or the suggested fix is
      actually problematic in some way. When this happens then ignoring it is fine, e.g:
       ```
      from aqt.qt import QMessageBox  # pylint:disable=no-name-in-module
       ```

   **Optional:** if you use gitkraken you have to adjust the pre-commit script (`anki-morphs/.git/hooks/pre-commit`) to
   activate the virtual environment first:

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   # File generated by pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com
   # ID: 138fd403232d2ddd5efb44317e38bf03
   
   # start templated
   ANKIMORPH_DIR=/home/mortii/git/anki-morphs/  # <--- ADD THIS LINE!
   INSTALL_PYTHON=/home/mortii/git/anki-morphs/venv/bin/python3
   ARGS=(hook-impl --config=.pre-commit-config.yaml --hook-type=pre-commit)
   # end templated
   
   HERE="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
   ARGS+=(--hook-dir "$HERE" -- "$@")
   
   if [ -x "$INSTALL_PYTHON" ]; then
       cd $ANKIMORPH_DIR && source venv/bin/activate  # <--- ADD THIS LINE!
       exec "$INSTALL_PYTHON" -mpre_commit "${ARGS[@]}"
   elif command -v pre-commit > /dev/null; then
       exec pre-commit "${ARGS[@]}"
   else
       echo '`pre-commit` not found.  Did you forget to activate your virtualenv?' 1>&2
       exit 1
   fi
   ```
