# Tests

The testing framework is `Pytest` with these plugins:
- [pytest-qt](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-qt/): allows for writing tests for PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2 and PySide6 applications.
- [pytest-xvfb](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xvfb/): allows tests to be run without windows popping up during GUI tests or on systems without a display (like a CI).
- [pytest-expect](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-expect/): stores test expectations by saving the set of failing tests, allowing them to be marked as xfail when running them in future.
- [pytest-sugar](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-sugar/): showing failures and errors instantly, adding a progress bar, improving the test results, and making the output look better.
- [pytest-randomly](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-randomly/): randomly order tests and control random.seed.

Some default options are set in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section.

## Running tests

From the project root folder you can run tests with the command `pytest`, and it will automatically gather and run all
the tests found in the `tests` directory.

You can restrict the tests to a specific file by appending the path(s) to the command, e.g:
```
pytest test/tests/recalc_test.py test/tests/review_test.py
```

You can also add "tags" to specific tests and run all the tests that have those tags. This is done by adding the
decorator `@pytest.mark.{tag}`, e.g. `@pytest.mark.external_morphemizers`, and you can then run those tests with the
command:
```
pytest -m external_morphemizers
```

> **Note**: the "tag" also has to be added to the "markers" list in `pyproject.toml` because we run tests with the
> `--strict-markers` argument.

You can specify how many fails the tests should abort after with the `--maxfail` argument, e.g:
```
pytest --maxfail=10
```

The `pytest-randomly` plugin runs the tests in a random order based on a seed. You can specify the seed:
```
pytest --randomly-seed=84903385
```

You can also rerun the last used seed:
```
pytest --randomly-seed=last
```

### Test coverage

Run: `pytest --cov=ankimorphs --cov-report html` and click on `index.html` in `htmlcov/`


## Card collections

Note:
  - all of these collections have all the extra fields selected
  - the extra fields contain inflections unless stated otherwise
  - morphs are evaluated based on inflections unless stated otherwise
  - morphs priority is 'Collection Frequency' unless stated otherwise

Current card collections (test/data/card_collections):
- `lemma_evaluation_lemma_extra_fields_collection.anki2`
  - contains two "known" cards ("the", "man"), and then 9 cards with 4 lemmas and 9 inflections.
  this is used for testing if the inflections are given the scores of their respective lemmas and
  the inflections are skipped on review.
  - the extra fields contain lemmas
  - morphs are evaluated based on lemma
  - morphemizer: 'spaCy: en_core_web_sm'
- `some_studied_lemmas_collection.anki2`
  - duplicate of `lemma_evaluation_lemma_extra_fields_collection.anki2`, but one card for each lemma
  has been studied, so the other cards that have those lemmas should contain no unknowns.
  - the extra fields contain lemmas
  - morphs are evaluated based on lemma
  - morphemizer: 'spaCy: en_core_web_sm'
- `big_japanese_collection.anki2`
  - monolithic card collection (https://github.com/mortii/anki-decks)
  - morphemizer: 'Ankimorphs Japanese'
- `ignore_names_txt_collection.anki2`
  - Contains one card that has two names, one of which is found in names.txt
  - morphemizer: 'AnkiMorphs: Language w/ Spaces'
- `known-morphs-collection.anki2`
  - contains one card with 7 morphs, 6 of which are found in the 'known-morphs-valid' directory
  - morphemizer: 'AnkiMorphs: Language w/ Spaces'
- `offset_new_cards_inflection_collection.anki2`
  - Contains two cards, both with "hello".
  - `recalc_offset_new_cards` config option enabled
  - morphemizer: 'AnkiMorphs: Language w/ Spaces'
- `offset_new_cards_lemma_collection.anki2`
  - duplicate of `lemma_evaluation_lemma_extra_fields_collection.anki2`, but has uses the `recalc_offset_new_cards`
  config option enabled
  - the extra fields contain lemmas
  - morphs are evaluated based on lemma
  - morphemizer: 'spaCy: en_core_web_sm'
- `some_studied_japanese_collection.anki2`
  - contains three cards:
    - one that has the tag 'am-known-manually'
    - one with a learning interval of 1 day
    - one with a learning interval of 30+ days
  - morphemizer: 'Ankimorphs Japanese'
- `max_morph_priority_collection.anki2`
  - contains two cards, and uses the priority file `ja_core_news_sm_freq_inflection_min_occurrence.csv`. One card
  has a morph that is found in the priority file, the other card does not, which should give it a max morph priority value.
  - morphemizer: 'spaCy: ja_core_news_sm'
- `card_handling_collection.anki2`
  - contains 6 cards:
    - 3 known, not new cards
    - 1 fresh, not new card
    - 1 with only known or fresh morphs, new card
    - 1 with known, fresh, and one unknown morph, new card
  - creating an evergreen collection that has fresh morphs is surprisingly difficult, because the
  due date of the card actually depends on the timestamp of card creation. To make this problem go away
  you can set the date of your system back a couple of months and then create the cards.
- `suspend_all_morphs_known.anki2`
  - the base of this collection is `card_handling_collection.anki2`, that has been recalced with
  the config `config_suspend_morphs_known`
- `suspend_morphs_known_or_fresh.anki2`
  - the base of this collection is `card_handling_collection.anki2`, that has been recalced with
  the config `config_suspend_morphs_known_or_fresh`
- `move_to_end_morphs_known.anki2`
  - the base of this collection is `card_handling_collection.anki2`, that has been recalced with
  the config `config_move_to_end_morphs_known`
- `move_to_end_morphs_known_or_fresh.anki2`
  - the base of this collection is `card_handling_collection.anki2`, that has been recalced with
  the config `config_move_to_end_morphs_known_or_fresh`


## Engineering and adding collections

1. create a new profile
2. create a new deck
3. create a new note type
4. add cards with the note type to the new deck
5. change the ankimorphs settings to fit the use case and recalc
6. exit anki/close the profile
7. extract the `collection.anki2` file from the profile directory and rename it
8. place the renamed collection file in `test/data/card_collections`
9. create a new config copy in `environment_setup_for_tests.py` and make any necessary adjustments

## Investigating collections

Basically reverse the steps in the section above, i.e:
1. extract the collection file you are interested
2. rename the collection to `collection.anki2`
3. place the file in the profile folder of a new anki profile
4. open the anki profile and the cards should be available for viewing


## Priority files

The priority files found in "correct_outputs" are generated with the following settings:
- all the file formats selected
- none of the preprocess options selected
- occurrences column is always added
- when comprehension is selected the target is always '90%'
- when minimum occurrence is used the target is always '1'
